The model was originally developed by David J. Bolder while working at the Bank of Canada.

Further development was provided by policymakers and researchers at the Bank of Canada and the Department of Finance Canada.

The User Guide and interactive code documentation were produced by Jeffrey Gao in the Funds Management and Banking Department at the Bank of Canada, with the assistance of colleagues at the Bank of Canada and the Department of Finance Canada, and based on past documentation by David J. Bolder, Simon Deeley, Kevin Dunn, Andrew Lee-Poy, Etienne Lessard, Tiago Rubin, and Nanxin Zhou.
